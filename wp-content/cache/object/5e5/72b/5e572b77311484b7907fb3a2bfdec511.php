<h2>Who We Are</h2>
Cyzerg is a forward-leaning IT services provider with a focus on improving the logistics industry. Our culture, values and community involvement are anchored in creating opportunity for every person and organization we work with. Our deep reservoir of IT talent and an insatiable drive to push technology to improve business outcomes propel us and our clients forward.[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fullwidth="off" background_color="#ffffff" inner_shadow="off" parallax="off" module_class="who-white-block who-page"][et_pb_row][et_pb_column type="4_4"][et_pb_text admin_label="Text" background_layout="light" text_orientation="left"]
<h3>Logistics Focus</h3>
Cyzerg believes highly integrated logistics technology can empower a logistics organization to function at peak performance. Years of experience servicing the logistics industry positioned Cyzerg perfectly to take advantage of the impact new technologies are having in the logistics and supply chain space. With a desire to lead this industry transformation, we transitioned to exclusively supporting the logistics industry in 2014. We now offer software and hardware solutions to help logistics operations enhance their productivity, eliminate large overhead investments in technology and most importantly, to grow. We are passionate about identifying, vetting and applying the latest technologies in logistics to give our clients a competitive edge and improve profitability â€” technologies like modern, best-of-breed WMS/TMS solutions, cloud computing, voice over IP and RFID. We give our clients cleaner data through integrations, greater reliability and uptime, better customer service, and shorter response times.

Cyzerg also provides outsourced day-to-day IT department operations and management, tiered IT service delivery to avoid over- or under-allocation of resources, and hourly, contractual or pay-as-you-go pricing.

<h3>Culture of Opportunity</h3>
Cyzergâ€™s company culture is based on teamwork and collaboration. Our philosophy is that when you care for your people, they care for you, and when they care for you, they care for your customers. Itâ€™s a win-win situation thatâ€™s good for business, but even more importantly, itâ€™s the right thing to do. Respect, integrity, sustainability, empowerment, passion and adaptability are all values that Cyzerg upholds.[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type="1_2"][et_pb_image admin_label="Image" src="http://www.cyzerg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/who-opportunity-big.jpg" url_new_window="off" animation="off" /][et_pb_text admin_label="Text" background_layout="light" text_orientation="left"]
<h3>Creating Opportunity for Those In Need</h3>
We believe business success should align with individual successâ€”on a global scale. Businesses really can be the catalyst for a happier society filled with successful people, and Cyzerg is built to be a leader-by-example. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve legally committed 21% of our profits to support The Anser Indicus Foundation, a non-profit organization providing training and education to families living in extreme poverty.[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][et_pb_row][et_pb_column type="4_4"][et_pb_text admin_label="Text" background_layout="light" text_orientation="left"]Cyzergâ€™s success is truly aligned with the success of both businesses and people. The better we serve our customers, the more successful they become, and the more we all can contribute to transforming our society for the better by helping those who need it most.Â We call this the Cyzerg Ripple Effect.[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fullwidth="off" background_color="#ffffff" inner_shadow="off" parallax="off" module_class="who-white-block who-page"][et_pb_row][et_pb_column type="4_4"][et_pb_text admin_label="Text" background_layout="light" text_orientation="left"]
